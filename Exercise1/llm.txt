ChatGPT-5 with basic free plan has been used for this exercise

Main motivation for using it was as a guide to go through the instructions pdf, help out with developing code for the containers to run and debug issues while testing code.

The LLM helped in many ways by fixing syntax issues, small queries and even git errors. 

LLM did have small errors, it tried to use deprecated libraries in the code, often rewrote the whole code block and disregarded previous context.

LLM would not have been able to create the whole exercise by just providing the pdf, overall it works good as a helper but context and human intervention is still needed.
